: This MATLAB tool provides a complete solution for converting between the four primary rotation representations used in aerospace engineering, robotics, and 3D graphics:
Euler angles, quaternions, Direction Cosine Matrices (DCM), and axis-angle parameters. 
The interactive command-line interface guides users through selecting their input type, entering rotation data, and choosing the desired output format, 
with intelligent handling of unit conversions between degrees and radians.
The tool implements mathematically rigorous conversion algorithms with built-in numerical stability features, such as adaptive switching in the DCM-to-quaternion conversion to avoid computational errors.
All conversions are performed through optimized direct-path functions rather than chaining multiple intermediate transformations, ensuring both accuracy and efficiency.
The code follows aerospace conventions including the scalar-last quaternion format and the roll-pitch-yaw Euler angle sequence, making it immediately compatible with standard navigation and control systems.
